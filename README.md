Have you ever wanted to search for a specific word in a youtube video. This is my attempt to do that. 

- Currently i'm using OpenAI's Whisper API to get a transcript of a video along with its timestamps at a segment level.
- Then I run a basic search to find all the timestamps for a specific word.
- The goal is to be a Chrome extension where you can jump through a video to each occurrnece of your searched word.
